# Stock-analysis
# The puropse of the project
*  We created Macros so that we do not need to run Analysis for each of the stock separately and we can see all the reults at the same time
*  Due to conditional formatting, Steve willl be able to see how the analysis have been quickly
* Updated Macro's can be used to run the analysis for any year.
Refactoring the code was done to slash the run time of the code.
**Advanatages of Refactoring codes**.
* Refactoring is a key part of the coding process,as it makes the code more efficient with fewer steps.
* Refactoring codes reduces the run time of the Macros.
* It looks much cleaner and helps the future user to understand and read it better.
**Disadvanatages of Refactoring codes**.
* Refactoring codes can be time-consuming.
* It might be difficult for larger and more complicated codes to refactor.
* It may sometimes alter the outcomes.

In this project, refactoring the code, using arrays, has reduced the run time from .9 to .2, which shows a dramtic increase and efficiency.
